## Healthcare Facilities in Japan: An EDA

This file contains the cleaned data used for the EDA

1. The dataset used for analysis, `pop_healthcare_facility_data.csv` was 104.1MB, hence it had to be placed in the .gitignore file and does not show up in the repo. This is the combined dataset containing data for the location and type of all healthcare facilities in Japan, the percentage of those over 65 years old that make up each city, and the number of those over 65 years old in each prefecture. The code book for this data set can be found under `codebook_geriatric_pop_healthcare_facility_data.csv`.

2. `healthcare_facilities_per_city.csv`: The number of healthcare facilities in each city in Japan.

3. `distinct_healthcare_facilities_per_city.csv`: The number of distinct healthcare facilities in each city in Japan
